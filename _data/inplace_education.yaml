    During my studies here, I participated in many perliminary ACM contests,
    one of which my team was first, and in one regional contest. My degree was
    supposed to take 4.5 years, but since I couldn't take one course I needed
    during my exchange period that is requirement for another course, I did one
    more semester with just one course. GPA: 9.81/10.

    During my last year, I led a group of 20 people to setup and run a cybercafe
    for a national high school sports event (Edeprem). Developed the website
    used for the event. The technologies I used were HTML, CSS, JavaScript and
    PHP using Wordpress with a custom theme I developed.
