    I'm currently pursuing my bachelor degree. During my studies here, I've
    participated in many perliminary ACM contests, one of which my team was
    first, and in one regional contest. My degree was supposed to take 4.5
    years, but since I couldn't take one course I needed during my exchange
    period that is requirement for another course, I expect to do one more
    semester with just one course.

    During my last year, I led a group of 20 people to setup and run a cybercafe
    for a national high school sports event (Edeprem). Developed the website
    used for the event. The technologies I used were HTML, CSS, JavaScript and
    PHP using Wordpress with a custom theme I developed.
