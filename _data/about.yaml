description: >
  I'm currently a Computer Science student aiming to become a
  professional software developer. My main interests are Artificial
  Intelligence, Machine Learning and Software Engineering. My favorite languages
  are Python, Ruby and Go, I've started to like Haskell a lot too. I love music
  and I play the drums. I really like scuba diving, even though I haven't done
  it for quite some time. I also love to travel and since last year
  I've become interested in photography. Food is something I really
  love, therefore I had to learn how to cook some [nice things](food) with the
  help of my family and friends.
