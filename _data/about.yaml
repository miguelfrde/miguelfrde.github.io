  I'm currently a software engineer at Google. My main interests are Machine Learning,
  Software Engineering, Programming Languages and Distributed Systems. My favorite
  languages are Python, Go and Haskell. I love music and I play the drums. I really
  like scuba diving, even though I haven't done it for quite some time. I also love
  to travel and photography. Food is something I really enjoy, therefore I had to
  learn how to cook some [stuff](food).
