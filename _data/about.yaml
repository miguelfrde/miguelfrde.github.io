description: >
  I'm currently a Computer Science student aiming to become a professional
  software developer. My main interests are Artificial Intelligence, Machine
  Learning and Software Engineering. My favorite languages are Python, Ruby
  and Go, I've started to like Haskell a lot too. I love music and I play the
  drums. I really like scuba diving, even though I haven't done it for quite
  some time. I also love to travel and since last year I've become interested
  in photography.
