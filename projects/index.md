## Personal projects

### Friendacity

<img src="/static/img/post_resources/friendacity.png" class="project-image" alt="Friendacity screenshot">
I made this website with the goal of providing an easy way for Udacity MOOC students to know each other.
In Friendacity, Udacity students can arrange meetups, find students who are similar (age, courses, country, etc.) to them and establish contact with them.
Developed using Python, JavaScript + jQuery and deployed to Google App Engine. I have stopped working on this project. Summer 2012.

### RushHour Solver
<img src="/static/img/post_resources/solver.png" class="project-image" alt="Solver screenshot">
Application developed to compare three search algorithms (DFS, BFS and A\*) for solving the puzzle RushHour (Unblock-Me). The heuristic used for A\* is the number of blocks in front of the main block plus one. Developed with Jorge Barba for the course *Data Structures and Algorithms II*. Spring 2013.
