## Personal projects

### Friendacity

<img src="/static/img/post_resources/friendacity.png" class="project-image" alt="Friendacity screenshot">
I made this website with the goal of providing an easy way for Udacity MOOC
students to know each other. In Friendacity, Udacity students can arrange
meetups, find students who are similar (age, courses, country, etc.) to them
and establish contact with them. Developed using Python, JavaScript + jQuery
and deployed to Google App Engine. I have stopped working on this project.
Summer 2012.

### Handwritten Digit Recognition
<img src="/static/img/post_resources/mlpnn.png" class="project-image" alt="MLPNN screenshot">
A Neural Network for recognizing digits. Simple implementation, trained using a
small dataset generated using the Training application that you can see on
Github. Future: train it using the MNIST dataset. Developed for the course *Data
Structures and Algorithms II*. Spring 2013.

### Orkoraptor
<img src="/static/img/post_resources/orkoraptor.png" class="project-image" alt="Orkoraptor screenshot">
Application to draw Flowcharts, run them and generate the code in four
programming languages. It allows to save the flowchart in .orko files and load
those fiels via drag and drop. Developed with Mario Leal for the course *Object
Oriented Programming*. Fall 2012.

### Image segmentation
<img src="/static/img/post_resources/imageseg.png" class="project-image" alt="Imageseg screenshot">

Implementation of two image segmentation algorithms using Minimum Spanning
Forests. The application allows to try different parameters to see their
effects. Developed for the course *Graph Theory, Networks and Applications*
during my exchange period at MDH. Fall 2014.

### Gamie
<img src="/static/img/post_resources/gamie.png" class="project-image" alt="MLPNN screenshot">
Application that allows teacher to setup great online courses and engages
students who take them, thanks to gamification concepts like levels,
achievements, lifes, etc. Built using Django. Developed with Fernando Padilla,
Jorge Barba and Iv√°n Alejandro Rojas for the course *Software Design*. Fall
2013.

### RushHour Solver
<img src="/static/img/post_resources/solver.png" class="project-image" alt="Solver screenshot">
Application developed to compare three search algorithms (DFS, BFS and A\*) for
solving the puzzle RushHour (Unblock-Me). The heuristic used for A\* is the
number of blocks in front of the main block plus one. Developed with Jorge Barba
for the course *Data Structures and Algorithms II*. Spring 2013.
