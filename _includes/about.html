          I'm currently a Computer Science student aiming to become a
          professional software developer. My main interests are Artificial
          Intelligence, Machine Learning and Software Engineering. My favorite
          languages are Python, Ruby and Go, I've started to like Haskell a
          lot too. I love music and I play the drums. I really like scuba diving,
          even though I haven't done it for quite some time. I also love to
          travel and since last year I've become interested in photography.
