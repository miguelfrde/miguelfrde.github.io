Hello world! My name is Miguel Flores. I'm currently a Computer Science student at ITESO in Guadalajara, Mexico. I'm interested in computer science, math, artificial intelligence, machine learning, music, technology, software, etc. After many years, I finally decided to setup a blog/personal webpage where I'll be posting Computer Science related stuff.

I made this website with the help of Jekyll, Bootstrap, Disqus, MathJax, and of course, GitHub Pages.

You'll see that many information is missing, I hope to add it soon. In the meantime you can contact me via the links that you can see on top.
